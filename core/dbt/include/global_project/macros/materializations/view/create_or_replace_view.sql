{# /*
       Core materialization implementation. BigQuery and Snowflake are similar
       because both can use `create or replace view` where the resulting view schema
       is not necessarily the same as the existing view. On Redshift, this would
       result in: ERROR:  cannot change number of columns in view

       This implementation is superior to the create_temp, swap_with_existing, drop_old
       paradigm because transactions don't run DDL queries atomically on Snowflake. By using
       `create or replace view`, the materialization becomes atomic in nature.
